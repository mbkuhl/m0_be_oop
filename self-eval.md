# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It felt like a bunch of puzzles and I loved it. I'm excited for what's ahead.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Taking breaks after git commits has actually been a great method for me. I can either take that break or not. Staying focused is not an issue if my phone is exactly 6 feet from me. Too far to grab, but close enough to know it's not ringing like crazy for some sort of emergency.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

Sometimes I wrote the correct lines of code, they were just in the wrong place. Try moving things around to see where they work, and also try to understand why that is.
